         Notes:
        1)Limitations upto 10 items in "Form" as straight forward.
            1.1)Forms also can be a Scrollable
        2)But if you want to add more than 10 then add as "Group"
        3)And if you want the group should be separated one, the go for "Section"
        4)When you scroll at top most of the screen, you will be able to see the first section values going beyond the screen. thats fine but its looks ugly. thats where the "NavigationView" plays the Role.
            4.1)After added the NavigationView its looks fine. but it will looks so empty there, there we have to add "NavigationBar" to have some set of decent title.
            4.2)By default Swift takes larger text. if you want you can customise with `displaymode` inline param.

     - Whichever we are making the properties are @State those are taking out of struct and keeping some where acting as reference.
     - Generally Apple suggesting us to go with @State for simple variable store/retrive inside the self view. Thats why it enforces us to use private access control

 Notes:
     1)We cannot simply put one TextField inside the form or simply return the textfield to the body.
     2)Because Swift needs to have some binding value. whatever user's typing on the textfield. what do you want to do with it.
     3)Okay then can we go with @State some variable, Yeah it is 80% job is done. but there its need to tell two way binding. because whenever the property or textfield value changes. both parties should get updated.
